Issue & Solution
================
This error occurs because the execution of PowerShell scripts is restricted by the system's execution policy.
To fix it, follow these steps:

1. Check the Current Execution Policy
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
Get-ExecutionPolicy
It might return something restrictive like Restricted or AllSigned.

2. Change the Execution Policy
Run the following command to allow script execution:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Explanation:
-Scope CurrentUser: Changes the policy for the current user only (doesn't require admin rights).
-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned: Allows locally created scripts to run but requires scripts downloaded 
from the internet to be signed.

3. Re-run the npm Command
Close and reopen PowerShell or your terminal, then run your npm command again.

4. (Optional) Reset the Policy After Use
If you prefer to restore the original policy after completing your tasks:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Restricted

https://mongoosejs.com/

npm install mongoose --save

============================
Nodemon - It is used to display the script output without running the command everytime.
============================
To run javascript file without nodemon, use the command 'node filename.js'
============================
To run javascript file with nodemon, we can use the command set in the package.json
npm run dev - It will run the JS file without running the file execute command everytime.
============================

Validations used in the user.js file would work only with Create / Save functions.
